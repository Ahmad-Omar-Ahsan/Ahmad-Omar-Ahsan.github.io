Hi there. I'm a computer science graduate who used to work as an AI engineer at Intelligent Machines. I obtained my CS Bachelor's degree from the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), in March 2021. Currently I am working as a research fellow at Fatima Fellowship 2022 for the group "Hyperbolic Geometry for Computer Vision".

My research interests include:

- Deep learning for vision, audio and graphs.
- Hyperbolic deep learning
- Resource-efficient deep learning algorithms
